			Looks like there are several native features that may be utilized through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and applied with Phone Gap. The feature that stands out the most for me would be the use of user notifications. Being able to alert a user can be a huge plus for an app. I’ve been playing Word Press on my iOS devices and it’s incredibly nice to see a notification when it’s my turn to play. On the other hand notifications can be extremely pesky and aggravating when over used. It is so annoying looking down at my device and seeing a dozen pointless notifications from Facebook. FB was the first app to have notifications disabled on my devices.
			</p>
			
			<p>Features that would pair well together:</p> 
			<p>Accelerometer, compass, and geolocation for tracking a user.</br>
			Camera, media, contacts, and storage for an Instagram style app.</br>
			It would be cool to see the camera used to make an app that can read ASL while someone is signing.</br>
			</p>
			 
			<p>
			I haven’t nailed down any particular design or features yet. I would however like to play around with features like the camera, geolocation, and tapping into some social APIs.
			</p>
			 
			<p>
			While learning about the new UICollecitonsView bundled with iOS I found it helpful watch the videos on the Apple developer portal and then experiment with it my self.
			</p>
			 
			<p>
			I think one of the biggest hurdles I recently jumped was learning about the new Auto Layout feature in interface builder. This was a step in the right direction for iOS layouts especially since the new iPhone 5 form factor arrived. I’ll admit that getting used to Auto Layout was a bit of a chore. I’ve been working with absolute layouts for so long that making the change from CGRectMake() to NSLayoutConstrait was kind of a big jump. Nevertheless the iOS dev portal videos proved helpful once again.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			They have 3 really enlightening videos about Auto Layout from the 2012 WWDC. After watching those it was mostly trial and error until laying out elements with Auto Layout felt natural. Don’t let the name fool you, it’s not as ‘auto’ as it may sound.

		<p>After reviewing the content on screen readers I realized some of my code may not play well with applications like Jaws. In some situations I’m using JavaScript to toggle some hide/reveal events and judging by the way that Jaws works a visually impaired user may have a difficult time knowing what my buttons do or even knowing that something has happened once they have clicked a button. One apparent change will be to make sure all of my anchor tags are appropriately named. A visually impaired user may not realize that “peeps” will take them to “contacts”.</p>


<p>I can imagine someone getting frustrated with a site that has random words linked to unrelated pages.</p>

<p>As a visual user I can simply skip over the annoying ads and try to dodge them with my cursor. However since some applications like Jaws present the user with a long list of links on the page they cannot always just overlook them.</p>

The Yahoo! Search & Yahoo! Finance apps have done a nice job of using UIAccessiblityElement properties like accessibilityLabel and accessiblityHint to help improve the user experience of their apps.

<p>Discussion: Market Research</p>
<p>
The App category for the US, Japan, and Great Britain is, without question, the games category. This is a broad category and encompasses games like Doodle Jump, Angry Birds, Words with friends, and Need for speed. Falling in behind would be applications that serve some sort of greater purpose. This might mean making our lives easier by converting our phones into flashlights or our phones converting one metric into another.
</p>
 
<p>
It appears that despite the diverse cultural makeup of the US, Japan, and Great Britain most people still feel the need to be entertained. The gaming and Hollywood industries rake in obscene amounts of dough each year due to our preoccupation with filling the entertainment holes in our lives. Smart phones have opened up new horizons for these industries in the form of micro transactions. Even during an economic recession most people feel comfortable dropping a buck here or there in order to play the latest Angry Birds obsession. This phenomenon follows closely behind a recent era where video games were most commonly played on PC’s, consoles, or handheld consoles. These games would easily sell for around $30-$60 each! So if a company or individual could produce a finely polished game and distribute it on the app store at a low price they might just strike gold.
</p>
 
<p>
It appears that the majority of Android users are always a few steps behind the latest OS release. This means that if you decide to make an application that takes advantage of any new features presented in the latest OS you may find yourself falling short in the available users department.
</p>
 
<p>
My suggestions:
</p>
<p>
    Make a game. Create something unique that has polish. It can be a paid app or it can be free. If you decide to make a free app then you will need to decide how you will create revenue. Will you display an ad banner or incentivize in-app purchases? If you want your game to be a hit then provide a means to localize your app so that it easily translates into other languages.
    Create a turn-by-turn based navigation app. Sure this has been done before but if you can make it better people will eat it up. Foldout maps are out and GPS based digital maps are in!
